# Final_Project_Comp-Sci_2
Computer Science 2- Final Project Project Report- Scheduler 

Background 
 	The goal of our final project was to create a simple, user-friendly program in C++. We chose to make a scheduler. The idea came from the need to help students or anyone with a busy week organize their tasks based on priority and available time. Originally, we decided on doing snake but we wanted something that would line up with our future jobs. We wanted the program to not only handle tasks, and time estimates but also take blocked or unavailable hours into account. 

Challenges Encountered 
 	One of the first challenges was structuring the program in a way that kept everything organized. We used object-oriented programming with inheritance and polymorphism, which was a bit tricky at first but helped keep the logic separated and clean. Another challenge was writing the sorting functions to prioritize tasks correctly and schedule them across multiple days without exceeding the time limits. Making sure the user couldnâ€™t enter duplicates or invalid inputs also took a lot of thought. 

Insights Gained 
	We learned how useful polymorphism and clean class design can be when building a larger program. Breaking the problem into smaller pieces like reordering tasks, calculating available time, and managing blocked hours made the whole system easier to manage. We also realized the importance of user input validation and clear output formatting to make the program actually usable. Overall, it helped us better understand how to apply C++ concepts like vectors, loops, conditionals, and class structure to solve a real-world problem, and help us in our future endeavors.
